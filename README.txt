This is an Enneagram test that you can take at the command line!

Simply put, an Enneagram test is a personality type test. There are nine
different personality types, each with their own unique characteristics. The
different types have different names that are associated with that type, like,
"The Observer", "The Helper", and so on, but they can also be referred to simply
by their number, "Type One", "Type Two", etc.
More broadly, however, it is a system rooted in modern psychology and ancient
spirituality with the intention of understanding an individual's behaviors and
attitudes. I find it fascinating in the psychological analysis and understanding
it brings, as well as the perspective on life that it gives.
Further, the system does not stop at suggesting that all people can be cleanly
categorized into nine groups but proposes further deliniation by way of
subtypes. A quick Google search will show that the types are organized on a
circle. The Enneagram suggests that people have a main type (for example Type 5)
and lean towards one of the two numbers next to it as a "wing" (Type 5 with a 4
wing). Now, suddenly, instead of only nine types there are twenty seven. And
there is even further deliniation that can take you closer and closer to
discovering what your full personality type might be. Investigating beyound
one's basic type, however, is outside the scope of this project.
If you're interested in learning more I would encourage you to read the book
from which this program is based; The Wisdom of the Enneagram by Don Richard
Riso and Russ Hudson.
