Type Nine: The Peacemaker

The easygoing, self-effacing type.
Nines are accepting, trusting, and stable.
They are good-natured, kind-hearted, easygoing, and supportive, but can also be too willing to go along with others to keep the peace.
They want everything to be without conflict but can tend to be complacent and minimize anything upsetting.
They typically have problems with passivity and stubbornness.
At their best, healthy Nines are indomitable and all-embracing; they are able to bring people together and heal conflicts.
