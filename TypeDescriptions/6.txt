Type Six: The Loyalist

The committed, security-oriented type.
Sixes are reliable, hardworking, and responsible, but they can also be defensive, evasive, and highly anxious---running on stress while complaining about it.
They are often cautious and indecisive but can also be reactive, defiant, and rebellious.
They typically have problems with self-doubt and suspicion.
At their best, healthy Sixes are internally stable, self-confident, and self-reliant, courageously supporting the weak and powerless.
