Type Two: The Helper

The caring, interpersonal type.
Twos are empathetic, sincere, and warm-hearted.
They are friendly, generous, and self-sacrificing, but they can also be sentimental, flattering, and people-pleasing.
They are driven to be close to others, and they often do things for others in order to be needed.
They typically have problems taking care of themselves and acknowledging their own needs.
At their best, healthy Twos are unselfish and altruistic and have unconditional love for themselves and others.
