Type Four: The Individualist

The romantic, introspective type.
Fours are self-aware, sensitive, reserved, and quiet.
They are self-revealing, emotionally honest, and personal, but they can also be moody and self-conscious.
Withholding themselves from others due to feeling vulnerable and defective, they can also feel disdainful and exempt from ordinary ways of living.
They typically have problems with self-indulgence and self-pity.
At their best, healthy Fours are inspired and highly creative, able to renew themselves and transform their experiences.
